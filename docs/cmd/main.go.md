# Plan for cmd/blog/main.go

This file serves as the main entrypoint for the application's command line interface. It typically uses a library like Cobra.

## Types

- None specific to this file.

## Functions

- `main()`: The main Go entry point. Initializes and executes the root command.
- `Execute() error`: The primary function (often part of the Cobra pattern) that executes the root command logic.
- `init()`: Go initialization function, used here to set up the root command, flags, and subcommands by calling functions like `NewServeCmd`, `NewBuildCmd`, `NewDeployCmd`.
