# Assets

The `assets.go` file handles the registration and management of static assets required by the feature.

## Responsibilities

- Register static assets with the application
- Provide access to feature-specific static files
- Handle asset embedding and loading

## Key Components

- Asset registration functions
- Path management for static resources
- File handling utilities

## Usage

The assets are typically registered during feature initialization and made available to the web UI components that need to reference static resources like images, stylesheets, or client-side scripts.
