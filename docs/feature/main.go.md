# Main Package

The `main.go` file serves as the central entry point and export location for the feature package. It re-exports necessary components from subdirectories to maintain a clean API for consumers of the feature.

## Responsibilities

- Provide the main package entry point
- Re-export important types, functions, and interfaces
- Initialize the feature when loaded
- Coordinate between different components of the feature

## Key Components

- Feature initialization functions
- Public API definitions
- Cross-cutting concerns

## Usage

Other parts of the application will import this package to access the feature's functionality. The main package should provide a clean, well-documented API that hides the internal complexity of the feature.
