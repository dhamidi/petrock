# Technology choices

## For code generated by petrock

- github.com/spf13/cobra for CLIs
- net/http.ServeMux for routing
- mattn/go-sqlite3 for sqlite3 access
- slog for logging
- maragu.dev/gomponents for frontend components
- golang.org/x/crypto for password hashing and other crypto functions
- github.com/google/uuid for UUID generation

## Architecture Components

- core/app.go: Central application initialization and coordination
- core/commands.go: Command registry and execution
- core/queries.go: Query registry and execution
- core/log.go: Persistent event log

## Application Flow

1. App initialization (core/app.go)
2. Feature registration (called by app.go before replay)
3. Log replay to rebuild state (after registration)
4. HTTP server setup and lifecycle (cmd/serve.go)
