# Deficiencies

## Better command/query validation

Includes better form objects.

## Tools and MCP support

* need to be added to introspection
* subcommand `serve` should accept protocol (http, MCP)

## Command/Query generators

## Asset pipeline

* plain JS with importmap support
* compression + hashing

## Rules

* working in a petrock generated project is still rough, as the AI is lacking context about important rules (e.g. no direct mutation of the state)
* we should automatically generate rules
