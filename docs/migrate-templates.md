Currently, the entire Go code is encoded as string templates inside the repository. Instead, I would like the Go code to be actual Go code using placeholder identifiers in a separate directory in the codebase.

Please create a plan that details the migration steps. We would need to take the current templates and convert them into actual Go code using placeholder identifiers.
